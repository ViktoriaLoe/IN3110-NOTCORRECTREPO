## Task 2.1


### Functionality

The script allows you to easily move whole directtories into others. It will check whether it exists or not, and if not you have the option to create one. Either with the name you first entered, or with the current date-name.
You can also specify what file types in the src directory you want to move.

### Missing Functionality

If you want to move a certain file type, but no files exist, an error will occur. 

### Usage

sh handy_functions src_dir dst_dir .filetype
